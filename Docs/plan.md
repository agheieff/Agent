Phase 1: Foundational Multi-Agent Architecture

    Goal: Enable multiple, distinct agent instances to run and communicate, managed by a central orchestrator.
    Steps:
        Agent Configuration: Define a standard way to configure an agent instance (e.g., using YAML or dataclasses). This config would specify:
            agent_id: Unique identifier.
            role: (e.g., "CEO", "ProjectManager", "Coder", "Tester", "Marketing").
            llm_config: Provider, model, specific API settings.
            system_prompt_template: Base prompt for the role.
            allowed_tools: List of tools this agent can use (permissions).
            knowledge_base_ref: (Optional) Pointer to relevant documents/data (initially maybe just file paths).
        Orchestrator/Kernel: Create a central async component responsible for:
            Loading agent configurations.
            Instantiating and managing the lifecycle of multiple AgentRunner (or refactored AgentInstance) objects.
            Routing messages between agents.
            Maintaining overall system state (which agents are running, basic task status).
        Communication Bus: Implement a mechanism for inter-agent messaging. Options:
            Simple Start: A shared asyncio.Queue managed by the Orchestrator. Agents put messages onto the queue with recipient IDs; the Orchestrator routes them.
            More Robust: Use a dedicated message queue (like RabbitMQ, Redis Pub/Sub) or a shared state database (like Redis, a simple relational DB).
            Define a standard message format (e.g., { "sender_id": "...", "recipient_id": "...", "task_id": "...", "content_type": "text/task/query/result", "content": {...} }).
        Agent Adaptation: Modify AgentRunner (likely renaming it, e.g., AgentInstance or Worker):
            It needs to accept its configuration upon initialization.
            Replace the main run loop's reliance on get_multiline_input. Instead, it should process incoming messages from the communication bus via the Orchestrator.
            Add a method like send_message(recipient_id, message_content) that puts a message onto the communication bus.
            The core _run_chat_cycle remains similar but is triggered by incoming messages/tasks rather than direct user prompts (except for the CEO agent).
        Initial Roles: Create basic system prompts for CEO (interacts with user, delegates high-level tasks), Manager (receives tasks, tries to break them down, delegates to specialists - initially maybe just one), and a generic Specialist (receives specific task, executes using tools, reports back).

Phase 2: Hierarchical Task Management & Collaboration

    Goal: Implement the CEO -> Manager -> Specialist task decomposition and workflow.
    Steps:
        Task Representation: Define a clear Task data structure (e.g., dataclass or DB model) including fields like task_id, parent_task_id, description, status (pending, assigned, in_progress, blocked, completed, failed), assigned_to_agent_id, results, dependencies.
        Manager Agent Logic: Enhance the Manager's prompt and potentially its core logic (or give it specific tools) to:
            Receive a task description.
            Analyze the task and break it down into sub-tasks suitable for different specialist roles.
            Identify appropriate Specialists (based on role/availability â€“ Orchestrator might help here).
            Create Task objects for sub-tasks.
            Assign sub-tasks by sending messages to Specialists via the bus.
            Monitor sub-task status and aggregate results.
        Specialist Agent Logic: Enhance Specialists to:
            Receive assigned tasks.
            Use their allowed tools to execute the task.
            Communicate back status updates, results, or requests for clarification (to the Manager or potentially other Specialists) via the bus.
        Orchestrator Enhancements: Help track task dependencies, manage agent availability/load, potentially re-assign tasks if an agent fails.
        Communication Protocols: Refine communication patterns for common interactions like task assignment, status updates, asking clarifying questions, and providing results.

Phase 3: Performance Monitoring & Basic Optimization

    Goal: Start tracking agent performance and enable rudimentary adjustments (initially manual, then potentially automated).
    Steps:
        Define Metrics: Determine how to measure "performance." This is crucial and hard. Examples:
            Task success rate (based on tool exit codes, Manager assessment, or testing results).
            Task completion time.
            Resource usage (e.g., token counts, cost).
            Number of clarification rounds needed.
            Code quality (if applicable, using external tools/linters triggered by the agent).
        Logging & Monitoring: Implement robust logging for agent actions, tool usage, communication, and task outcomes. Store this data systematically.
        Feedback Mechanism: Determine how feedback is generated. Can Specialists report detailed success/failure? Can Managers evaluate Specialist output? Can the testing agent provide feedback?
        Configuration Management: Store agent prompts, allowed tools, and KB references in a way that's easily modifiable (e.g., database, version-controlled files).
        Manual Tuning Interface: Create a way (even simple file editing) to adjust prompts or configurations based on observed performance logs.
        (Advanced) Optimization Agent: Introduce a meta-agent or module:
            Analyzes performance logs and metrics.
            Uses an LLM to suggest modifications to prompts or configurations for underperforming agents.
            Potentially applies these changes automatically (requires careful control). This starts edging into self-optimization.

Phase 4: Self-Modification Capabilities

    Goal: Enable the agent system to modify its own codebase and potentially deploy changes. This is the most complex and potentially risky phase.
    Steps:
        Code Manipulation Tools: Create highly privileged tools:
            read_code_file: Reads specific source files (needs path validation).
            edit_code_file: Edits source files (using similar logic to edit_file but with extreme caution, perhaps requiring multi-step confirmation or targeting specific functions/classes).
            write_code_file: Creates new source files.
        Testing Tools:
            run_tests: Executes the project's test suite (test.py).
            parse_test_results: Interprets the output of the test runner to determine success/failure/specific errors.
        Deployment/Execution Tools (Use with Extreme Caution):
            execute_shell_command: A sandboxed tool to run specific, whitelisted shell commands (e.g., git commit, git push, maybe a restart script systemctl restart agent_service - very risky). Needs robust input validation and permission control.
        "Software Engineer" Agent Role: Define an agent with prompts and logic focused on:
            Understanding requirements for code changes (e.g., "build a live dashboard").
            Planning code modifications (which files, functions, classes).
            Reading existing code using tools.
            Writing new code/modifying existing code using tools.
            Writing unit/integration tests for the changes.
            Using testing tools to verify changes.
            Potentially using deployment tools (after thorough testing and maybe confirmation).
        Version Control Integration: The system should likely operate on a version-controlled codebase (e.g., Git) so changes can be tracked, reviewed, and potentially reverted. Self-modification tools would interact with Git.

Key Considerations Throughout:

    State Management: How is the state of agents, tasks, and conversations persisted? Simple memory won't scale; a database or persistent storage is needed.
    Asynchronous Operations: The Orchestrator and agents need to run concurrently using asyncio.
    Error Handling & Resilience: What happens when an agent fails, a tool fails, or communication breaks down? Need retry mechanisms, error reporting, potential task reassignment.
    Cost Tracking: Monitor token usage and API costs per agent/task.
    Security & Permissions: Carefully control which agents can use which tools, especially code modification and shell execution tools. Sandboxing is critical.
    Scalability: Consider how the system would scale if you had hundreds or thousands of agents/tasks. Message queues and robust databases become essential.
