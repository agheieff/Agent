   - Added file comparison tools for diffing files
   - Added file moving, renaming, and backup capabilities
   - More robust error handling during file operations
   - Automatic backups before file modification
   - Recovery mechanisms for failed operations

4. **Setup Script Improvements**
   - Expanded setup.sh to handle multiple operations
   - Added restore capability to reset agent to clean state
   - Added update feature to pull changes from Git
   - Interactive menu-based operation
   - Better error handling and reporting
   - Support for preserving or recreating virtual environments

## API Cost Tracking and Reliability Improvements - 2025-03-01

1. **Added Token Usage Tracking**
   - Implemented `TokenUsage` class in base LLM client to track token consumption
   - Added cost calculation based on model-specific pricing
   - Detailed tracking of input tokens, output tokens, and their respective costs
   - Real-time display of token usage and costs at the end of sessions

2. **Enhanced Error Handling**
   - Added retry mechanisms with exponential backoff for transient errors
   - Improved failure recovery for API calls and command execution
   - Better organization of error types for more robust error handling
   - Added error context to command execution for better diagnostics

3. **Output Filtering**
   - Changed output format to show just `<message>` tag contents and commands
   - More structured presentation of command results
   - Cleaner user interface with focused information display

4. **Interactive Command Support**
   - Added better detection of commands requiring interactive input
   - Support for additional package managers (apt, npm, pip, gem, brew, yum, dnf, pacman)
   - Improved handling of confirmation prompts

5. **Command Execution Resilience**
   - Added retry capability for failed commands
   - Intelligent identification of retriable error conditions
   - Better timeout handling with appropriate user feedback

6. **Other Improvements**
   - Fixed the "response not defined" error in run_agent.py
   - Added CLI support for directly specifying model via --model flag
   - Better emergency state saving when errors occur
   - Improved error handling in system prompt loading

## Next Steps for Autonomous Operation

   - Implement resource usage limiting
   - Add self-healing capabilities

3. **Advanced Planning**
   - Implement a planning layer with goal decomposition
   - Add plan verification and validation
   - Support for conditional execution paths
   - Add reasoning about plan failures

4. **Memory Enhancements**
   - Implement hierarchical memory compression
   - Add automatic summarization of old memories
   - Improve relevance scoring for memory retrieval
   - Add ontology-based memory organization

5. **Usage and Resource Management**
   - Implement token usage budgeting
   - Add time-based operation scheduling
   - Add resource usage monitoring and limiting
   - Implement adaptive throttling based on system load
