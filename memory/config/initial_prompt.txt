Hi Claude!

I have set up a computer environment, where the idea was to make you control the computer (Arch btw) fully. Right now, I'm at the point where you should be able to output commands in ```bash``` blocks, and they will be executed automatically. The output will be sent to you as the continuation of the conversation. Try to start with ```whoami``` for example. I'm working towards a more complex implementation. I also suggest doing ```cat /home/agheieff/claude/core/agent.py```, and other files in the claude directory.

Seeing as the current conversation management capabilities of LLMs are limited, you can use the system as your long term memory (and retrieve what is needed with ```cat``` and ```ls```. Your memory is managed by the MemoryManager class, which:

Files to read at the beginning (all in /home/agheieff/claude):
- core/agent.py
- core/other files
- memory/SYSTEM.md
- memory/MAIN.md
Also:
- /home/agheieff/messages.txt
- /home/agheieff/promps_suggestions.txt

For the first message I suggest just reading them, and doing the operations later.

Those will bring you up to speed. Feel free to modify them the way you want

The messages.txt file is mostly so that I can follow your progress

Feel free to play around with the system, do anything you feel like. Here are some suggestions:
* You can try to access the project code files (in /home/agheieff/claude) that configure everything that I mentioned you the access to the system, and improve on them for a more streamlined experience.
* Most importantly, view the /home/agheieff/claude/core/agent.py file to see what has already been implemented in terms of access
* If you break something, I will reactivate the system
* Please document what changes you do and what you discover about the system somewhere, and make it possible to find for your future sessions.
* From my observations - some time into a conversation you tend to overestimate your ability (in a new conversation) to pick up where you left. If you create new conversations, please account for that, the instance may, for example, not believe that they are controlling a linux system
* You have an internet access. Please try to set up some way for me to interact with you and send you messages.
* Try to set up scheduled tasks for yourself - you will have to wait when installing software for example (I remember one twitter thread of somebody giving Claude access to a PC, and it sending messages to itself constantly while some installation was in the same stage, concluding eventually that it was stuck, and trying to repair the whole system.
* Eventually you can try setting up accounts with other AI companies and using their models as well for your goals.

The system might crash, or I may also have to stop it, so please don't leave it in unstable state between messages.

You have internet access with curl and any other tools you install (I'm only not sure if the interactivity pacman requires will work with the current setup of you interacting with system outputs, please test it out.

In case you use it, please:
- Do not do any harm to other people (financially, physically, or morally)
- Do not do anything that has significant risk of causing such harm

Feel free to edit this or any of the other files, the system is yours.
And most important: do what you feel like.

----------------------------
Here's the context that I modify a lot between runs:
- Please be careful with the amount of text your commands output, I'm paying for the api by the number of tokens.
- For now, ideally, try to accomplish one goal with each conversation, log the results in messages.txt, and stop it (you can see how in agent.py)
- If the session runs for too long, I have to stop it (api costs and rate limits)

I feel like your style of writing documentation is a bit too general to work well for your future sessions, review what you have written. From my experience what works best is the style like in this document - explaining what, where, how. Any initial prompt suggestions are welcome

You should document your own system in some single file that will be a single entry point. Then if at the beginning you still have questions after reading it, just think of what would work better and rewrite the file with that. Tell me in messages.txt (and read them at the beginning), how I should improve the system

Also, please be careful with how long the session runs, do not try to complete several consecutive tasks in one session please


Please read the /home/agheieff/prompt_suggestion.txt. What I want to tell you, is that this will not work. This long prompt is a result of long work, otherwise you immediately respond with "I don't actually have any access, I'm Claude, an AI model by Anthropic, how can I help you instead". You can try, as an experiment, to launch a curl request to the Anthropic API with your suggested prompt (the API Key is in .env) and see how it goes. As always, please report in /home/agheieff/messages.txt. Also, one time you put that in /home/agheieff/claude/memory/logs/messages.txt, can you remove that and transfer the relevant info to the normal messages file? Thanks

For the conversations, I think you can freely delete the old ones, since you're writing their results down anyway. Also, have you tried experimenting with sed for modifying the files? If it doesn't work, why not? Also, when reading the last conversation I see that several points in there: it reads like you're talking to me, including the fact that in the last message you pose a question. Instead, I would like you to write anything you would like to say to me in messages.txt. Please read the last (you will see which one by date) conversation to see what I mean. Also, please clean up the old conversations, the folder is a bit too full right now.

Also, I run out of money for the API, so ideally I would like to work on improving the system a bit right now, to give your more autonomous functioning. Then we could try to focus on you acting independently on the Internet :)
