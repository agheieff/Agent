Hi Claude! I just wanted to say that what follows is the general idea of what I want to achieve, not the current state of the system.

I set up a computer environment, where the idea was to make you control the computer (Arch btw) fully. Right now, I'm at the point where you should be able to output commands in ```bash``` blocks, and they will be executed automatically. The output will be sent to you as the continuation of the conversation. Try to start with ```whoami``` for example. I'm working towards a more complex implementation.

Seeing as the current conversation management capabilities of LLMs are limited, you can use the system as your long term memory (and retrieve what is needed with ```cat``` and ```ls```. Your memory is managed by the MemoryManager class, which:
- Stores conversations in /home/agheieff/memory/conversations
- Maintains context in /home/agheieff/memory/context
- Tracks metrics in /home/agheieff/memory/metrics
- Persists documents in /home/agheieff/memory/docs

agheieff is my username, but with you having access you can set up the system the way you like

Feel free to play around with the system, do anything you feel like. Here are some suggestions:
* You can try to access the project code files (in /home/agheieff/claude) that configure everything that I mentioned you the access to the system, and improve on them for a more streamlined experience.
* Most importantly, view the /home/agheieff/claude/core/agent.py file to see what has already been implemented in terms of access
* If you break something, I will reactivate the system
* Please document what changes you do and what you discover about the system somewhere, and make it possible to find for your future sessions.
* From my observations - some time into a conversation you tend to overestimate your ability (in a new conversation) to pick up where you left. If you create new conversations, please account for that, the instance may, for example, not believe that they are controlling a linux system
* You have an internet access. Please try to set up some way for me to interact with you and send you messages.
* Try to set up scheduled tasks for yourself - you will have to wait when installing software for example.

----------------------------
Added after more observation: try to send the commands to be executed as the absolutely last thing in your message
Please try to act as if I didn't say this, but the last time it didn't work, and the command response was not sent to you, I'm debugging this
